## Dental Research Design (guest lecture)

This page has resources related to the lecture given by Chandler Pendleton and Tabitha Peter to the Research Design course at the University of Iowa College of Dentistry. Chandler & Tabitha both represent the Division of Biostatistics and Computational Biology. 

### For students in the Research Design course

**What to prepare for class**

 You should come with a rough draft (written down) of a research question or problem of practice that you are currently studying. This draft can be in bullet point form -- we are going to teach you how to articulate your ideas into a strong research question. 

 In addition, you will probably want a copy of the handout for taking notes. See 'handout.pdf' for the handout PDF. 

**What to expect**

 This guest lecture will be formatted as two mini-lectures, each lasting about 45 mins. The first session will teach you how to write a strong research question for a dental research project. The second session will teach you how to discern the type of study and type of data that you need to address your research question. Both sessions will include student participation (e.g. polls, think-pair-share), so come ready with your phone/laptop/tablet. You will get a short break between sessions.


**What you will learn**

Together, these mini-lectures should equip you to start a collaborative dental research project with an effective initial meeting -- the kind of meeting where everyone can articulate a shared goal, and each person leaves knowing exactly what action items need to happen to move the work forward.
