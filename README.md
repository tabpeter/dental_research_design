## Dental Research Design (guest lecture)

This page has resources related to a talk I gave to students in the Research Design course at the University of Iowa College of Dentistry.

Students in that course are probably most interested in these files: 

    * handout.pdf: The downloadable version of the handout to accompany the lecture. 
    * pres.html: A copy of the presentation slides. You can open these in your favorite web browser.
