## So you have a strong research question... what do you need next?

![](img/gold.jpg){.absolute right="500"}

::: notes
The goal of this mini-lecture is for students to learn how to discern the type of study, the type of data, and type of design needed to address a specific research question. By the end of this lesson, students will know how to take their research question and draft an appropriate research proposal.

When you pan for gold, you have to know 1) where to go, and 2) what type of pan/other tool to bring with you. The research process is similar -- you need to think through where and how to collect your data!

## Menu overview: how to prepare a dental research proposal

::: notes
Determining the type of study, type of data, and type of design you need are the steps that directly follow the formulation of your research question (connection to Chandler's talk)
:::

1.  Write down a research question

::: {.fragment .highlight-blue}
2.  Identify what type of study you need to answer your question
3.  Determine the type(s) of data you need to collect
4.  Choose an appropriate study design
:::

::: notes
-   Connect back to Chandler's presentation
-   Emphasize the second and third points (give Chipotle example - introduce extended metaphor)
-   Note that these steps are what must take place before

# Identifying the type of study

## Observational v. experimental?

## Example 1: observational or experimental?

::: {.fragment .fade-out}
I am an endodontist who wants to compare different kinds of treatments for SIP first and second molars. Treatment A is the standard of care, but I think the new Treatment B might be just as good, if not better. Do I need an observational study or an experimental study to answer my question?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
I need an experimental study -- the factor I want to set to a specific level is the treatment each SIP molar receives.
:::

## Example 2: observational or experimental?

::: {.fragment .fade-out}
I am a pediatric dentist who wants to see if children who come to the clinic from farther away are less likely to complete their follow-up appointment compared to children who live closer to CoD. Do I need an observational study or an experimental study to answer my question?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
I need an observational study. I will not change the patients' distance traveled to CoD, and I do not want to deliberately change treatment completion. I want to look back at dental records and see if there is a pattern.

# Determining the type of data

## Independent or correlated?

![](img/dice.png)

## Example 3: independent or correlated?

::: {.fragment .fade-out}
I am working with an experimental study with mice. I have 50 mice from 12 different birth cohorts, and each mouse is either a mutant or a control. I want to compare the physical features of these mice. Are the data from the mice independent, or correlated?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
The data are **correlated** by birth cohort -- I would need to adjust for the impact of birth cohort when I compare the individual mice.
:::

## Example 4: independent or correlated?

::: {.fragment .fade-out}
I am working on an experimental study to compare dental materials. I have collected data by taking extracted teeth, cutting the teeth into slices, and randomly assigning each slice to a treatment group. Are the data from the tooth slices correlated, or independent?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
The data from the tooth slices are **correlated**, even despite the randomization. Randomly assigning tooth slices to treatment groups does not change the fact that slices from the same tooth are correlated. The data collection should keep track of which tooth slices came from the same tooth.

# Choosing a study design

## How long until (some event of interest) happens?

![Jain 2022](img/km_curve.png)

::: notes
Is anyone working with time-to-event data for their research? (POLL)
:::

## What happens to (some unit of study) over time?

![Levy 2001](img/fluoride.png)

::: notes
Is anyone working with longitudinal data for their research? (POLL)
:::

## Are the (units of study) in group A different than those in group B?

![Praetorious 2013](img/case_cntrl.png){width="817"}

::: notes
Is anyone working with case-control data for their research? (POLL)
:::

## What do people in this specific group think/experience/learn/have access to?

![Wolfe 2006](img/survey.png)

::: notes
Is anyone working with survey data for their research? (POLL)
:::

## What generalization can we make about the literature in this specific area?
