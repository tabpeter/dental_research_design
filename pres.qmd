## So you have a strong research question... what do you need next? 

![](img/gold.jpg)

::: notes
The goal of this mini-lecture is for students to learn how to discern the type of study and type of data needed to answer a given research question. By the end of this lesson, students will know how to determine the type of study they want to conduct and the type of data they want to collect.
:::

## Menu overview: what are the steps in conducting dental research?

1.  Write down a research question

::: {.fragment .highlight-blue}
2.  Identify what type of study you need to answer your question
3.  Determine the type(s) of data you need to collect
::: 

4.  Consult a biostatistican to write a statistical analysis plan
5.  Collect the data
6.  Analyze the data according to your statistical analysis plan
7.  Draw an inference based on the evidence in the data

## Building a research plan is like building a burrito bowl

# Identifying a study type

## Building blocks: observational v. experimental?

## Example 1: observational or experimental?

::: {.fragment .fade-out}
I am an endodontist who wants to compare different kinds of treatments for SIP first and second molars. Treatment A is the standard of care, but I think the new Treatment B might be just as good, if not better. Do I need an observational study or an experimental study to answer my question?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
I need an experimental study -- the factor I want to set to a specific level is the treatment each SIP molar receives.
:::

## Example 2: observational or experimental?

::: {.fragment .fade-out}
I am a pediatric dentist who wants to see if children who come to the clinic from farther away are less likely to complete their follow-up appointment compared to children who live closer to CoD. Do I need an observational study or an experimental study to answer my question?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
I need an observational study. I will not change the patients' distance traveled to CoD, and I do not want to deliberately change treatment completion. I want to look back at dental records and see if there is a pattern.

# Surveying common types of data in dental research

## How long until (some event of interest) happens?

Addressing this kind of question requires time-to-event (survival) data

## What happens to (some unit of study) over time?

Addressing this kind of question requires longitudinal data. This kind of data involves repeatedly measuring the study units at several points in time.

## Are the (units of study) in group A different than those in group B? Watch and see...

-   This kind of study is typically a case-control study, where the two groups you want to compare are the "case" group and the "control" group.

## What do people in this specific group think/experience/learn/have access to?

-   Addressing this type of question often calls for a survey. Survey studies are most commonly **observational**

![Wolfe 2006](img/survey.png)

## What generalization can we make about the literature in this specific area?

-   A study that studies other studies is a meta-analysis. Specifically, the aim of a meta-analysis is to aggregate results from the literature in a particular field and make a generalization.
